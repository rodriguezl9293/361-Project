            <h2>Axl's thoughts on the Show Quality</h2>
            <p>The quality of shows over the last 6-8 years has 
                significantly gone up. I remember that shows were
                sitcoms growing up with about 20-30 episodes per season.
                And while yes, some of them are still my favorites like 
                "How I Met Your Mother", I much prefer to watch excellent shows 
                like "The House of the Dragon". The quality of production, acting,
                storyline is incomporable. I am glad to be living in an era with great 
                tv, there are so many good things to watch and endless.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Even the shows that are on the funnier side and not having long drawn out 
                storylines are excellent pieces of work. For instance "Curb Your Enthusiasm" 
                starring Larry David, such a well written show and hilarious. The draw that this
                show has is that the jokes are continuous thought a whole season or possibly multiple
                seasons. Larry David knows how to write a good show, he wrote "Seinfeld" after all, and 
                yes, while that is a sitcom he know how to adapt to creating shows in this day and age.</p>
            <br>
                <p>I feel as though all the shows I am referring to are fro HBO Max and that is true, most of
                the TV I watch is from HBO. They really have a good production company and are great about 
                being inclusive. They gave rise after all to Issa Rae with "Insecure" another great show that is
                funny, emotional, and about navigating the world as a person of color. Words cannot describe how 
                great of a writer Issa is.</p>
